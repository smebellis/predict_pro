## Overview

The **Data Preprocessing Pipeline** is a Python-based tool designed to clean, transform, and enhance raw taxi trajectory data. This pipeline systematically processes the data to prepare it for downstream analysis or machine learning tasks. Key functionalities include handling missing data, timestamp conversion, travel time calculation, polyline processing, and feature engineering.

## Features

- **Missing Data Handling**: Removes entries with missing GPS data to ensure data integrity.
- **Timestamp Conversion**: Transforms UNIX timestamps into human-readable datetime formats.
- **Travel Time Calculation**: Computes travel time based on polyline data, assuming each point represents 15 seconds.
- **Polyline Processing**: Converts polyline strings to lists and extracts start and end locations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Adds temporal features such as weekday, month, and year.
- **End Time Calculation**: Determines the trip's end time by adding travel time to the start time.
- **Data Saving**: Saves the processed data in various formats, with options to prevent overwriting existing files.
- **Robust Logging**: Implements comprehensive logging to track the preprocessing steps and handle errors gracefully.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7 or higher**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
